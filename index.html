                <h1>Swartz IV</h1>
            <h1>A long time ago</h1>
            <p> The virus that must not be named had destroyed the civilization as we knew before 2021.
                In order to recreate our world, web developpers were called to help. <br>
                As they were not many up to that year,
                BeCode was charged to give the looked forward skills to 30+ people. <br>
                BeCode gave them the <b>force</b>.
                Now, it was up to them whether they were going to use those competences for the greater good,
                or go to the dark side and help the humanity vanish for good.</p>
